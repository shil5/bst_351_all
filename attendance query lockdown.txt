Dear Sir


I am a student of a Central University. Due to unavoidable health reasons, before the lockdown started,my attendance in one paper went as low as 56%. When this came to my knowledge,  I tried my best to not miss any classes thereafter, whatever be the state of my health. But, still I couldn't do much as the lockdown came and we had to rush home. I thought that maybe I'll recuperate the loss through the online zoom classes that the teacher will be conducting. But sadly, the teacher didn't take any more than 4 or 5 classes and the classes ended. Now, I am so worried that I wouldn't be able to recuperate my loss. What do I do? Sir, keep in mind that my attendance got low BEFORE the lockdown. Can you please tell me about the measures that I can take for this?  How do I get my attendance above 75%?
Sadly the instructor that takes the paper has never been that helpful towards me and is not willing to tell me my current attendance.
